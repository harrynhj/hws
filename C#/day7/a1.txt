1. Describe the problem generics address.
Generic address the problem of code duplication and type safety
Without generic, we have to write duplicate code for each different object type
or just use Object keyword which is not type safety

2. How would you create a list of strings, using the generic List class?
List<string> = new List<string>();

3. How many generic type parameters does the Dictionary class have?
Two, one for key one for value

4. True/False. When a generic class has multiple type parameters, they must all match.
False, Ex: Dictionary

5. What method is used to add items to a List object?
List.add()

6. Name two methods that cause items to be removed from a List.
List.Remove(), List.RemoveAt()

7. How do you indicate that a class has a generic type parameter?
use <> bracket after the class name

8. True/False. Generic classes can only have one generic type parameter.
False, Ex: Dictionary

9. True/False. Generic type constraints limit what can be used for the generic type.
True

10. True/False. Constraints let you use the methods of the thing you are constraining to.
True
